Built this landing page template built for indie hackers and solopreneurs who need to quickly launch their product's web presence. I've used it multiple times so time can be spent focused on deploying the product instead of a landing page every time.

### Features

- Pre-built sections for all essential content:
  - Hero section with compelling value proposition
  - Feature highlights
  - Pricing tables
  - FAQ section
- Modern dark theme design
- Fully responsive for all devices
- Built with performance in mind
- Easy to customize

### Tech Stack

- React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui components
- Vite
